# Proposed spec for neuroglancer precomputed meta file

[Neuroglancer precomputed volume](https://github.com/google/neuroglancer/blob/master/src/neuroglancer/datasource/precomputed/README.md) is a versatile yet simple file format for the purpose of streaming multi/high resolution volume data. However, it is not without its faults. Amongst these are:

- Having to deal with millions, if not billions of files
- Lack of a "header" file, which describes some physical attributes of the volume

We are aware of the following initiatives, which to various degrees solves some of above:

- [ome-ngff](https://ngff.openmicroscopy.org/latest/)
- [zarr](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs)

## Proposal

We propose the introduction of `meta` extensionless json file, at the same hierarchy as `info` file. So the file structure looks like:

```
- root
    - info
    - meta
    - 1mm
        - 0-64_0-64_0-64
        ...
    - 2mm
        - 0-64_0-64_0-64
        ...
```

# Generic Image

Generic image, with arbitary dimensions.

type: `object`

| --- | --- | --- |
| type | `"image"` | true |
| range | ([Value Range](#definitions-range))[] |  |

<a name="definitions-data-image-1d"></a>

# Single Channel Image

Describes an image with 1 dimension, e.g. used as greyscale image.

Describes an image with 3 dimensions, mostly used as RGB image.

Describes the range of values

# Override

Overrides provide some low level/implementation hints. They are more prone to breaking, and thus should be used with the knowledge as such.
