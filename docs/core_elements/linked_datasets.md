# Datasets linked to locations in the brain

siibra provides access to data features anchored to locations in the brain. Locations can be defined in very different ways, such as  by specification of a brain region (thus only providing a semantic definition), a coordinate in a reference space, or a bounding box in a reference space. Data features represent datasets hosted on a public repository, typically but not exclusively the EBRAINS Knowledge Graph. A growing share of linked datasets are directly interpreted by siibra-explorer, which means that siibra-explorer offers direct access to the underlying data: Further than just displaying information about the dataset, siibra can visualize the data itself and allows to download it. These directly interpreted features are categorized into molecular, cellular, functional, fibres, connectivity and macrostructural. Many additional datasets are linked to brain regions, which only provide a metadata description and link to the corresponding dataset page on their original repository.
