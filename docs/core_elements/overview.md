# Core elements of an atlas in siibra

A typical brain atlas consists of 

- a reference coordinate space with a brain reference template, typically a structural image of the brain
- a parcellation map, which labels coordinates in the reference space with an identifier of a brain region,
- a taxonomy, which defines the names of brain regions used by the parcellation, and links them to the identifiers used in the parcellation map.

siibra extends this basic concept by linking multiple spaces and parcellation maps with complementary properties, and combining them with multimodal data features that capture characteristic aspects of brain organisation for locations in the brain.
