# Storing and Sharing 3D Views

## Bookmarks

Any views in `siibra-explorer` can be shared via their URLs. You can use any native share functionality offered by your browser, or manually copy the URL.

!!! info
    Automatic markdown renderer such as rocketchat can interfere with the rendering of the URL. To circumvent the issue, it is recommended that you generate a sane URL, or use a `code` block to escape markup

## Creating short URLs ("saneURL")

Whilst `siibra-explorer` encodes the current view directly in the URL, such full URLs are quite long and not easily recitable or memorable. You can create short URLs for the current view directly in `siibra-explorer`. To do so,

1. expand the *navigation panel*, 
2. click the "share icon", then 
3. select `Create custom URL`.

!!! warning
    Links generated by unauthenticated users will expire automatically after 72 hours. To circumvent the expiry, ensure you are logged in using an ebrains user account. Links generated by an authenticated user does not expire.

## Taking Screenshots

While you can use any screenshot tool provided by your browser or operating system, `siibra-explorer` offers a dedicated screenshot function which generates a clean image of the current 3D view which hides other user interface elements. To access the screenshot tool, 

1. choose the tool menu (`᎒᎒᎒`) from the top right (see [main UI elements](../ui/main_elements.md#tools-and-plugins)), then 
2. select `Screenshot`.
