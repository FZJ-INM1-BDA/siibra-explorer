# v2.14.11

## Feature

- (experimental) showing coordinates of all warped spaces

## Bugfix

- Fixed inconsistent saneurl creation (Thanks to Sebastian Bludau for reporting this)


## Known regressions

- Labelled assignment now does not work. This will be addressed in a future update. (The temporary regression allows for significant performant statistical assignment, as well more accurate label assignment.)
