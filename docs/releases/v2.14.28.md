# v2.14.28

## Feature

- annotations zip files can now be drag-dropped onto the atlas canvas

- side effect of unifying drag-drop interface: urls - with appropriate prefix e.g. `precomputed://`, `deepzoom://`, etc - can be drag-dropped to be visualized. Just like drag-dropped files, their state does not persist

## Behind the scene

- unified drag-drop interface, cleaned up unused components
