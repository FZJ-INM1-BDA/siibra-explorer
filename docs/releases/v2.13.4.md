## Feature

- Properly navigate to volume of interest based on volume meta:
    - properly calculate the orientation
    - properly calculate enclosed, and navigate to closest point if outside

## Bugfix

- Fixed expected siibra-api version

## Behind the scenes

- Temporary workaround for volume meta
- More efficient caching of meta retrieval
