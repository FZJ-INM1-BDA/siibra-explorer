# v2.13.4

## Feature

- Properly navigate to volume of interest based on volume meta:
    - properly calculate the orientation
    - properly calculate enclosed, and navigate to closest point if outside
- Added button to navigate to the point assignment UI

## Bugfix

- Fixed expected siibra-api version
- Fixed previously selected point not rendering

## Behind the scenes

- Temporary workaround for volume meta
- More efficient caching of meta retrieval
