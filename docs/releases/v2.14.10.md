# v2.14.10

## Bugfix

- Fix deployment scripts
- Fix region update to updated siibra-api endpoint

## Behind the scenes

- Re-enable siibra-api warning mismatch warning
- Adapt to siibra-api v0.3.18 point assignment rhetoric
- Enable cheat code, removing obsolete experimental flags
- If `HOST_PATHNAME` env is provided, also listens on root path
- Added servicemeta endpoint

## Known regressions

- Labelled assignment now takes a little longer. Additionally, the assigned value does not match that of the index label. This will be addressed in a future update. (The temporary regression allows for significant performant statistical assignment, as well more accurate label assignment.)
