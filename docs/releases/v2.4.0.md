- Allow for finer controls over meshes display (#883, #470)

- deprecated `getToastHandler` and `geModalHandler` in plugin API
- updated `openid-client` (#696) and removed unused dependencies
- allowing for `/user` and `/user/config` endpoints to return non error, even if the user is not logged in. (#767)
- use routing instead of query param (#858)
