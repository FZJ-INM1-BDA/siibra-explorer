# Getting Started

!!! tip "Launch siibra-explorer on EBRAINS"
	To launch siibra-explorer, **<https://atlases.ebrains.eu/viewer>** in your web browser. 

Recommended browsers are up-to-date versions of [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox) and [Google chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome). Newer versions of [Apple Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/) also work fairly well. Note that your hardware needs to support the WebGL2 standard, which should be the case for recent devices. If in doubt, check compatibility at <https://get.webgl.org/webgl2/>. 

An overview and the basic functionalities of siibra-explorer is presented in the quick tour, which is automatically launched on first use. You can always revisit the quick tour via the help menu, which can be found under the `?` icon at the top right of the UI, or using the `?` / `h` keyboard shortcut. 

Using the browser on your table or mobile phone should work in many cases as well, try it out!
