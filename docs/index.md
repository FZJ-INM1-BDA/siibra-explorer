## Overview 

siibra-explorer is a browser based 3D viewer for exploring multi-resolution brain atlases and discovering data features linked from different repositories to anatomical locations, covering a broad range of neuroscientific data modalities . The viewer provides an intuitive way of navigating brain reference volumes and  3D parcellation maps from conventional millimeter scale down to microscopic resolution. You can select different species, brain reference spaces and parcellation maps, search region hierarchies, and select brain regions to access detailed information. Data features are dynamically retrieved for selected parcellation regions or 3D views.
