# Saving/Sharing view

There are two types of URLs that can be used for saving or sharing the current view of siibra-explorer: full URL or custom URL.

## Full URL

siibra-explorer stores most of the state in the URL. The link can be bookmarked, copied, or shared, and the view will be preserved.

## Custom URL

There exist several disadvantages associated with full URL: they are lengthy, difficult to read and reproduce, and are often broken by automatic text formatting in emails, chat apps. 

siibra-explorer therefore offers a way to generate a more human readable link. Click on the share button `[->]` in the coordinate navigator next to the physical coordinates, and then `[Create custom URL]` you can generate a shortened and memorable URL.

!!! Warning
	Links generated by unauthenticated users will expire automatically after 72 hours.
