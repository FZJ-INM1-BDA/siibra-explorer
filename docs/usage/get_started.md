To launch siibra-explorer go to [https://atlases.ebrains.eu/viewer/](https://atlases.ebrains.eu/viewer/) in your web browser. The human atlas will be automatically selected.

If this is your first time using siibra-explorer, you will be prompted to take a quick tour. The quick tour can give a good first overview on siibra-explorer and explains the usage of basic functionalities.

You can always revisit the quick tour by first bringing up the help panel with the `[?]` key, or by clicking the `(?)` button at top right corner. Afterwards, the option to relaunch the quick tour can be found at the bottom of the help panel.
