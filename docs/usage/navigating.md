# Navigating

In the case of a surface template, siibra-explorer shows a single view presenting the surface of the reference template.

In the case of a volumetric template, the selected reference template is presented in a 3D view with orthogonal cross-sections.

Independent of the actual resolution of the volumetric reference template, the 3D whole brain view has limited resolution. It is designed as a 3D topographical orientation and will always show the brain as a whole. If the reference template is high-resolution, the slice views allow zooming into full resolution. 

Depending on the used device the navigation actions may vary slightly:

| | Desktop | Mobile |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Translating / Panning | `click drag` on any _slice views_ | `touchmove` on any _slice views_ |
| Oblique rotation | `shift` + `click drag` on any _slice views_ | `pinch rotate` |
| Zooming (_slice view_, _3d view_) | `mouse wheel` | `pinch zoom` |

To reset all views click on the coordinate navigator at the top. There you can separately reset the views to the initial position, orientation, and zoom. This panel also allows you to copy or set the location of the current viewâ€™s center, which is marked by the colored axes. Moreover, you can toggle the coordinate units between physical (mm) and voxel.

In addition to exploring all views at once, a slice view can also be maximised by pressing `[ ]` located at the bottom right of the slice view.
