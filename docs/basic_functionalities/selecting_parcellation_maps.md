When selecting a species, a default reference space and parcellation will be automatically preselected.
If you switch to a different reference space, `siibra-explorer` will first check if a map of the currently selected parcellation is available for the chosen space. If it is not, you will be asked to select a different parcellation.
Vice versa, when selecting a different parcellation which is not available in the currently selected reference space, you 

Maps from the Multilevel Human Atlas can be available in different reference spaces and resolutions: We provide volumetric (ICBM 2009c nonl asym, MNI Colin 27), high-resolution volumetric (BigBrain) and surface-based (fsaverage) reference spaces. If you change the reference space, you might need to change the parcellation, if it is not mapped in the selected reference space. The system will give you the advice.
