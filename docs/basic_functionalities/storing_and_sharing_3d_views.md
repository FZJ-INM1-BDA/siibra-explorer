# Storing and Sharing 3D Views

## Bookmarks

Any views in siibra-explorer can be shared via their URLs. You can use any native share functionality offered by your browser, or manually copy the URL.

!!! info
    Automatic markdown renderer such as rocketchat can interfere with the rendering of the URL. To circumvent the issue, it is recommended that you generate a sane URL, or use a `code` block to escape markup

## sane URL

Whilst sharing views with URLs are convenient, full URLs are lengthy, fail to be recitable or memorable. While you can use any URL shortener, siibra-explorer provide a URL shortener. To access this service, expand navigation panel, click share icon and click `Create custom URL`.

!!! warning
    Links generated by unauthenticated users will expire automatically after 72 hours. To circumvent the expiry, ensure you are logged in using an ebrains user account. Links generated by an authenticated user does not expire.

## Taking Screenshots

Whilst you can use any browser level or OS level screenshot tool, siibra-explorer also offers a screenshot tool. To access the screenshot tool, click `Plugin`, then select `Screenshot`.

!!! info
    Screenshot taken by the built in screenshot tool hides all UIs.
