    "description": "`siibra-explorer` is a browser based 3D viewer for exploring brain atlases that cover different spatial resolutions and modalities. It is built around an interactive 3D view of the brain displaying a unique selection of detailed templates and parcellation maps for the human, macaque, rat or mouse brain, including BigBrain as a microscopic resolution human brain model at its full resolution of 20 micrometers.

    "schema:releaseNotes": "# v2.14.10\n\n## Bugfix\n\n- Fix deployment scripts\n- Fix region update to updated siibra-api endpoint\n\n## Behind the scenes\n\n- Re-enable siibra-api warning mismatch warning\n- Adapt to siibra-api v0.3.18 point assignment rhetoric\n- Enable cheat code, removing obsolete experimental flags\n- If `HOST_PATHNAME` env is provided, also listens on root path\n- Added servicemeta endpoint\n\n## Known regressions\n\n- Labelled assignment now takes a little longer. Additionally, the assigned value does not match that of the index label. This will be addressed in a future update. (The temporary regression allows for significant performant statistical assignment, as well more accurate label assignment.)\n",
